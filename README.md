## Overview: 
For this project, An analysis will be preformed on NYC bike riding data from CitiBikeNYC (https://citibikenyc.com/). Using tableau, Visual representations will be created to spark ideas on how a bike riding service could be suitable for Des Moines, Iowa.

Here are seven figures taken from the dashboard above: 

figure 1.1: Checkout Times for Users

!["Checkout_Times_for_Users"](https://github.com/Calebmkelly/bikesharing/blob/main/Images/Checkout_Times_for_Users.png)

in figure 1.1, The Checkout Times for Users is shown and is sectioned by hour. The majority of the data occurs in the first hour, with most rides ending around the 10 miniute mark, following a steep decline into the 20 minute mark.

figure 1.2: Checkout Times by Gender

!["Checkout_Times_by_Gender"](https://github.com/Calebmkelly/bikesharing/blob/main/Images/Checkout_Times_by_Gender.png)

in figure 1.2, The Checkout Times for Users is shown, but is filtered by Gender. It Appears that Bike riding is male dominate, incurring a ride count of 108,087; compared to the Female counterpart with a ride count of 34,151. Unknown Genders has the fewest ride count, 7,389.

figure 2.1: Trips by Weekday

!["Trips_by_Weekday"](https://github.com/Calebmkelly/bikesharing/blob/main/Images/Trips_by_Weekday.png)

in figure 2.1, A heat map helps visualize the Ride acivity for each weekday by Hour. Peak hours occur around 8:00AM and 5:00PM during the weekdays, and within 8:00AM and 5:00PM on the weekends. Thursday seems to have the most activity, especially around 5:00PM and 6:00PM.

figure 2.2: Trips by Gender by Weekday

!["Trips_by_Gender_(Weekday per hour)"](https://github.com/Calebmkelly/bikesharing/blob/main/Images/Trips_by_Gender_(Weekday%20per%20hour).png)

in figure 2.2, The heatmap from figure 2.2 is filtered by gender. Similarly, Peak hours occur around 8:00AM and 5:00PM during the weekdays, and within 8:00AM and 5:00PM on the weekends for both genders. Both Genders seem to have Thursday as the most active day, with 5:00PM and 6:00PM having the most activity.

figure 2.3: User Trips by Gender by Weekday

!["Trips_by_Gender_by_Weekday"](https://github.com/Calebmkelly/bikesharing/blob/main/Images/User_Trips_by_Gender_by_Weekday.png)

in figure 2.3, another heatmap of ride data is displayed and organized by user type, Customer and Subscriber, by Gender, and by weekday. Again, Male Riders tend to have the most activity, with the most activity occuring on thursday and friday. Unknown genders have the lowest activity, and show almost no activity for the subscriber user type.

figure 3.1: Bikes Due to Repair

!["Bikes_Due_to_Repair"](https://github.com/Calebmkelly/bikesharing/blob/main/Images/Bikes_Due_to_Repair.png)

in figure 3.1, a plot of the Bike IDs is paired with the number of trips each ID has taken. it appears that IDs "30000" and above have more activity, and may need more repairs than other Bike IDs.

figure 4.1: August Peak Hours

!["August_Peak_Hours"](https://github.com/Calebmkelly/bikesharing/blob/main/Images/August_Peak_Hours.png)

figure 4.2: August Peak Hours Hightlight

!["August_Peak_Hours"](https://github.com/Calebmkelly/bikesharing/blob/main/Images/August_Peak_Hours_(highlight).png)

above are figures 4.1 and 4.2, they demonstrate the peak hours for Bike Riding in August. Peak hours tend to occur at 8AM and 5PM.

## Summary:
The Visual representations illustrating the CitiBikeNYC data display key information that can be useful for starting a bike riding service in Des Moines, Iowa. In Figures 1.1 and 1.2 the Checkout times are graphed by users and by gender. Checkout times peak at around the 6 minute mark, and rapidly decline afterwards. Gender seems to not effect checkout times. Because the checkout times are so small, it may be best to have bike stations close to each other. In Figure 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3, Heat maps are used to explore the trips by weekday, then filtering through gender and user type. The heat maps show most activity occuring right before and after work, 9AM and-5PM, and thursday having the most activity. When broken down by gender, the amount of bike rides tend to be male dominant. when broken down by usertype, a similar pattern appears in the subscriber type, with little activity occuring for the Customer type. in figure 3.1, a dot plot listing the bike IDs and there Ride count is shown. Looking at the graph, bikes with IDs "30000" and above tend to have more use and thus may need more attention for repair. investigating why these specific IDs have more use may give key information for the Des Moines Bike startup. in figure 4.1 and 4.2, the peak ride hours are display for the month of august. Overlapping with previous graphs, the peak hours tend revolve around the beginning and end of the average hour day.
